# google-homepage
In this project, I recreated the Google homepage (visually, not functionally) to familiarize myself with HTML and CSS.  
If I were to do this again, I would make a few key changes:
- Use Grid over Flexbox for the primary layout
- Adjust search bar and button graphics on hover
- Re-create the navigation bar and footer using list elements
